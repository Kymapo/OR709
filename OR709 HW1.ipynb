    "For the base case, we consider starting at vertex $n$. It is already defined that $f_n = 0$. Since it is assumed that all $d_{ij}$ on the graph are non-negative, we can know that this is an optimal solution.\\\n",
    "Next assume that $f_{i+1}$ is the optimal shortest path length from vertex $i+1$ to $n$. Then consider $f_i$, which is defined as $$f_i = \\min_{j∈N(i)} \\{d_{ij} + f_j\\}, i ∈ \\{1, . . . , n − 1\\}.$$\n",
    "Both $d_{ij}$ and $f_j$ (which can be taken as our $f_{i+1}$ here) are known from previous steps or problem definition. Thus when considering the neighbors of $i$, we can compare the values of $d_{ij} + f_j$ and take the minimum. This will be the shortest path length because the shortest path lengths of the neighbors have already been optimized."

    "Assume that there is not a unique solution for the optimal path length, i.e., there are multiple optimal path lengths. Then it must be the case that for two solutions $x, y, x \\leq y$ or $y \\leq x$ since the values associated with each path are unique real numbers. But then that would imply that one value is optimal (lower) compared to the other. So it cannot be that there are multiple optimal path lengths. Thus the equations must only have one unique solution."
