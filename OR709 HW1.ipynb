    "Assume that there is not a unique solution for the optimal path length, i.e., there are multiple optimal path lengths. Then it must be the case that for two solutions $x, y, x < y$ or $y < x$ since the values associated with each path are unique real numbers. But then that would imply that one value is optimal (lower) compared to the other. So it cannot be that there are multiple optimal path lengths. Thus the equations must only have one unique solution."
